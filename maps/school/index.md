# School

**Size: Medium**

An abandoned highschool.

## Tips

- during setup, split up and go to the corners of the building to quickly find the ghost's room
- walk through the building and ask for a sign from the ghost and look for open doors and lights turned on
- it does not have lockers or cupboards to hide, so you must find a room and close the door to hide
