# Spirit Box

This item is used to talk to the ghost if the ghost is nearby and if the ghost responds to the spirit box. If it responds to you then it is a form of evidence.

## Evidence

If you say anything into the Spirit Box and you hear someone reply using the Spirit Box (it is usually a single word answer) then you have collected the "Spirit Box" evidence.

**You do not need to take a photo of the Spirit Box for the evidence to count.**

## What should I ask it?

Technically it can give you hints about itself and what to do to defeat it however in most cases just getting a response is enough. You can leave the Spirit Box anywhere and move on with the game.

## What can I ask it?

Here is a list of questions you can ask it: [https://gameplay.tips/guides/8529-phasmophobia.html](https://gameplay.tips/guides/8529-phasmophobia.html)

## With voice detection

You can test if your voice detection is working by turning on the spirit box and asking "are you there". If it the ghost responds or says "Nothing Detected" on the device then it is working.

**Ensure you have not alt-tabbed from the game and that you have clicked on the game window so that voice detection works!**

## Without voice detection

Say anything into your mic and (if the ghost heard you) it will give you a random response
