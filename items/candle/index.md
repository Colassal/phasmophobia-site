# Candle

The candle is a simple but useful item for lighting up areas inside the building.

The ghost can make the candle go out which gives you a hint that they are nearby.

## Tips

- some houses have spare candles around that you can light and move
- light candles with other candles
- bring a candle around as an emergency light source
- place in corridors to help track the ghost
