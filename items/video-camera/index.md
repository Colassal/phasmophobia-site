# Video Camera

A camera that can be placed anywhere and what it captures can be seen on the monitor in the truck.

Use it to spot Ghost Orbs and to track players and the ghost itself.

## Tips

- place it in the ghost's room with video of the EMF Reader and Ghost Writing Book to remotely get the evidence
- only take it into the building when you have located the ghost's room so you have extra slots for other items
- place it on a Tripod for better vision
- carry it on your hip to help someone in the truck help you
