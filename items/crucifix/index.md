# Crucifix

**Range: 3 meters (6 meters for Banshee)**

The crucifix is used to reduce the chances of a hunt if placed in the room of the ghost.

Some ghosts dislike the crucifix so can protect the user from being attacked depending on the ghost.

## How to use it - ghost's room

When you find the room the ghost is haunting, place the crucifix in the middle of it on the floor (this doesn't really matter but it is easy to remember where you put it).

## How to use it - defending yourself

If the ghost dislikes crucifixes you can have it on your belt or in your hand and the ghost is less likely to attack and kill you.

## Tips

- if you have a spare slot and there is one already in the ghost's room, leave it on your belt
- if the ghost is avoiding you so you cannot complete objectives it might be afraid of your crucifix
- ensure the Crucifix is in the middle of the room as the range is low
