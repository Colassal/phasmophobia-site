# Crucifix

**Range: 3 meters (6 meters for Banshee)**

The crucifix is used to reduce the chances of a hunt if placed in the room of the ghost.

Some ghosts dislike the crucifix so can protect the user from being attacked depending on the ghost.

## How to use it - ghost's room

When you find the room the ghost is haunting, place the crucifix in the middle of it on the floor.

It has a range so if you place it on one side of the room there is a chance the ghost will spawn on the opposite side and still hunt.

## How to use it - defending yourself

If the ghost dislikes crucifixes you can have it on your belt or in your hand and the ghost is less likely to attack and kill you.

## Tips

- if you have a spare slot and there is one already in the ghost's room, leave it on your belt
- if the ghost is avoiding you so you cannot complete objectives it might be afraid of your crucifix
- ensure the Crucifix is in the middle of the room as the range is low
