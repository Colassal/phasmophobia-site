# Smudge Stick

This item is a single-use item and can be used to help defend yourself during the hunt.

When the hunt has begun (the lights have stopped flickering) and the ghost is nearby, light it with a ligher and the ghost will avoid trying to kill you (but not your nearby friends).

## Completing the optional objective

Use the smudge stick correctly to complete the optional objective for a reward.

## Tips

- bring the maximum of 4 smudge sticks to help defend yourself
- place a smudge stick in a common place such as a side table everyone passes for emergency situations
- leave the lighter near the smudge stick otherwise the stick is useless

- Smudge Sticks can no longer be used to take the Ghost out of it's hunting phase. Instead it will now have a delayed use and stop the Ghost from targeting a player for a short time to give you extra time to hide.
