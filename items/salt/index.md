# Salt

Place salt inside the building to see if the ghost is moving through an area (if the ghost does not fly). If a ghost walks through it then the pile of salt will be disturbed and the UV light might reveal footprints.

You can place 3 piles of salt per cannister of salt.

## Wraiths

The wraith ghost flies and does not leave a footprint or disturbs the salt.

Use the salt to defend yourself against the wraith ghost when it is hunting.

## Tips

- place the salt in doorways and at the top or bottom of stairs for maximum chance of a ghost using it
