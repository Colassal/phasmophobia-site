# Salt

You can place up to 3 piles of salt on the floor inside the building. If a ghost walks through it then the pile of salt will be disturbed and the UV light might reveal footprints.

## Wraiths

The wraith ghost flies and does not leave a footprint or disturbs the salt.

Use the salt to defend yourself against the wraith ghost when it is hunting.

## Tips

- place the salt in doorways and at the top or bottom of stairs for maximum chance of a ghost using it
