# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### When does the timer start?

When you open the front door of the building.

### How do I end the game?

One person must enter the 3 forms of evidence, select the ghost then use the keypad in the van.

### Can I die in the van?

Technically yes but it is very very very unlikely.

### Can I die outside the building?

Yes if you just moved outside and the ghost thinks you are still inside. The ghost is designed not to move outside.

### How often does the ghost hunt?

It is random. It could be 10 seconds after the last hunt or could be 5 minutes. It depends on the ghost type too.

## Items

### Why did my items disappear in the lobby?

When you die you lose all of the items you added to the lobby you died in. Any items you did not add should not be lost.
