## What questions can you ask

There is a very long list of all possible phrases you can ask the ghost. Try out these kinds of questions:

- "Give us a sign"
- "Are you there"
- "Turn on the lights"

**Remember that the ghost can hear you even without the Spirit Box. When it is hunting keep your voice quiet!**

### Ouija Board

There are additional questions you can ask using the Ouija Board such as:

- "What is your favourite room"
- "How old are you"

etc.

## Tips

- speak slowly and clearly to help the voice detection
- speak the ghost's name inside the building to anger it so you can find where it is
