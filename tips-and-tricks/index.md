# Tips and Tricks

## Use a kitchen timer during the setup time

Bring along a physical or phone timer during the setup time to let you know how long is left in the setup phase.

**If you alt-tab to a website for a timer it might break your voice recognition!**

## Avoid the darkness

It drops your sanity which makes the ghost stronger.

## Only take items with you during setup that you need to use to find the ghost

The remaining items can be retrieved when you return to the van.

## Avoid going too close to walls as you could glitch through them

Some maps make you fall through the walls and unless you have a "playspace mover" you cannot fix yourself.
